# Decentralized Oracle

## Basics
- **Team Name:** SaaS3
- **Project start**: 2023-06-02

## Project Overview
### Overview

**Summary:  SaaS3 is a protocol in layer2 that is highly scalable, crypto incentivized, and results in a solution that can serve as a decentralized APIs (dAPI) middleware to provide off-chain services to blockchain smart contracts.**

#### Brief Introduction

**Background**

Dilemma of web3 Ecosystem - With functionalities yet to become full-fledged, Web3.0 applications need a rethink of development stacks. For instance, most of the web2 projects and dependencies are based on Java, C++, PHP, etc., while web3 requires another totally different technical stacks such as Solidity, Motoku, or Substrate on EVM / WASM which hinders web2 developers to build web3 applications.

**Our solution - SaaS3 Oracle**

SaaS3 aims to deliver a highly scalable, crypto token incentivized and fully decentralized software as a service (SaaS) network which results in a solution that allows anyone to define and deploy customized oracles according to their Dapp needs. SaaS3 is devoted to transforming traditional web2 API to web3 dAPI.

Essentially, SaaS3 is an TEE powered oracle infrastructure that allows anyone to define and deploy custom oracles according to their Dapp requirements. SaaS3 utilizes TEE technologies, while still enabling decentralization, trustless and secure computation by the secure hardware guarantee of Intel SGX chipset designs and by delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus.

Therefore, such an infrastructure is not only for oracles that provide data feeds but also any type of computation which requires safe exchange of data. 

Examples: 

1. Any data feed: 
   - Price of assets (ERC20/NFTs) on CEX and DEX.
   - Random Numbers
   - Weather reports, price of rent of an apartment, supply chain data, FIFA match results...
2. Cross-chain data: 
   - Bridges and cross-chain relayers
3. Computation
   - Decentralized off-chain computation to enable truly decentralized metaverses and games
4. Any Dapp that requires trust:
   - Custodian account managed by TEE for GameFi users that allows them to interact with the blockchain with only web2 api requests.

SaaS3 enables Dapps to become as versatile as any other web2 application available today on the internet. As a result, the SaaS3 project will bridge web2 APIs to web3 dAPIs to flourish web3 ecosystem and achieve creator economy in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. This grant will allow us to develop several ink! smart contracts and a pallet for DAO management.

#### Hackathon roadmap

- We plan to develop a website displaying house prices which is a typical example of off-chain data feed.
  - [ ] A website that displays house prices
  - [ ] A smart contract that fetches house prices from saas3 oracle service
  - [ ] A saas3 oracle service that fetches house prices from web2 api
