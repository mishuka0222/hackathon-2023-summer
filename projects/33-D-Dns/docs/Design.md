# 1. Domain name registration:
## 1.1 Register New Domain Names

Function Name: `registerDomain`

Parameters:

- `domainName` (string): The name of the domain that the user wishes to register.
- `ownerAddress` (address): The address of the user that will own the domain.
- `registrationDetails` (struct): A data structure containing details such as the owner's contact information and any domain aliases.

Pseudocode:
```Solidity
function registerDomain(string domainName, address ownerAddress, RegistrationDetails registrationDetails) external {
    // Check if the domain name is already registered
    require(!isDomainRegistered(domainName), "Domain already registered.");

    // Check if the domain name format is valid
    require(isValidFormat(domainName), "Invalid domain name format.");

    // Create a new Domain object
    Domain newDomain = Domain({
        name: domainName,
        owner: ownerAddress,
        registrationDetails: registrationDetails,
        expirationDate: block.timestamp + 1 year
    });

    // Add the new domain to the domain registry
    domainRegistry[domainName] = newDomain;

    // Emit a DomainRegistered event
    emit DomainRegistered(domainName, ownerAddress, block.timestamp);
}
```
Explanation:

- This function first checks if the domain name is already registered by calling the `isDomainRegistered` helper function. If it is, the function throws an error and terminates.
- Next, it checks if the domain name format is valid by calling the `isValidFormat` helper function. If it's not, the function throws an error and terminates.
- It then creates a new `Domain` struct with the provided domain name, owner's address, and registration details. The `expirationDate` is set to one year from the current time.
- The new `Domain` is added to the `domainRegistry`, which is a mapping from domain names to `Domain` structs.
- Finally, it emits a `DomainRegistered` event, which includes the domain name, the owner's address, and the timestamp of the registration.

The struct `RegistrationDetails` could look something like this:

```Solidity
struct RegistrationDetails {
    string ownerContactInformation;
    string[] domainAliases;
}
```

This struct contains the owner's contact information and any domain aliases as a string array. Note that the exact fields in this struct may vary depending on your specific requirements.

## 1.2. Transfer Domain Ownership

Function Name: `transferOwnership`

Parameters:

- `domainName` (string): The name of the domain for which ownership is being transferred.
- `newOwnerAddress` (address): The address of the user that will be the new owner of the domain.

Pseudocode:
```Solidity
function transferOwnership(string domainName, address newOwnerAddress) external {
    // Check if the domain name is registered
    require(isDomainRegistered(domainName), "Domain not registered.");

    // Check if the sender is the current owner of the domain
    Domain domain = domainRegistry[domainName];
    require(msg.sender == domain.owner, "Only the domain owner can transfer ownership.");

    // Transfer the ownership of the domain to the new owner
    domain.owner = newOwnerAddress;

    // Emit a OwnershipTransferred event
    emit OwnershipTransferred(domainName, msg.sender, newOwnerAddress, block.timestamp);
}
```
Explanation:

- This function first checks if the domain name is registered by calling the `isDomainRegistered` helper function. If it's not, the function throws an error and terminates.
- It then checks if the sender of the transaction (`msg.sender`) is the current owner of the domain. If not, the function throws an error and terminates.
- The ownership of the domain is transferred to the new owner by updating the `owner` field of the `Domain` struct in the `domainRegistry`.
- Finally, it emits a `OwnershipTransferred` event, which includes the domain name, the old owner's address, the new owner's address, and the timestamp of the transfer.

## 1.3. Update Domain Registration Details

Function Name: `updateRegistrationDetails`

Parameters:

- `domainName` (string): The name of the domain for which details are being updated.
- `newContactInfo` (string): The updated contact information for the domain owner.
- `newAlias` (string): The new alias for the domain.

Pseudocode:
```Solidity
function updateRegistrationDetails(string domainName, string newContactInfo, string newAlias) external {
    // Check if the domain name is registered
    require(isDomainRegistered(domainName), "Domain not registered.");

    // Check if the sender is the owner of the domain
    Domain domain = domainRegistry[domainName];
    require(msg.sender == domain.owner, "Only the domain owner can update registration details.");

    // Update the contact information and alias of the domain
    domain.contactInfo = newContactInfo;
    domain.alias = newAlias;

    // Emit a RegistrationDetailsUpdated event
    emit RegistrationDetailsUpdated(domainName, newContactInfo, newAlias, block.timestamp);
}
```
Explanation:

- This function first checks if the domain name is registered by calling the `isDomainRegistered` helper function. If it's not, the function throws an error and terminates.
- It then checks if the sender of the transaction (`msg.sender`) is the owner of the domain. If not, the function throws an error and terminates.
- The contact information and alias of the domain are updated with the new values provided as parameters to the function.
- Finally, it emits a `RegistrationDetailsUpdated` event, which includes the domain name, the new contact information, the new alias, and the timestamp of the update.

## 1.4. Renew Domain Registration

Function Name: `renewDomainRegistration`

Parameters:

- `domainName` (string): The name of the domain for which the registration is being renewed.
- `additionalYears` (uint): The number of additional years for which the domain registration is being renewed.

Pseudocode:
```Solidity
function renewDomainRegistration(string domainName, uint additionalYears) external payable {
    // Check if the domain name is registered
    require(isDomainRegistered(domainName), "Domain not registered.");

    // Check if the sender is the owner of the domain
    Domain domain = domainRegistry[domainName];
    require(msg.sender == domain.owner, "Only the domain owner can renew registration.");

    // Check if the correct fee has been paid
    require(msg.value >= renewalFee * additionalYears, "Insufficient fee.");

    // Extend the expiration date of the domain
    domain.expirationDate += additionalYears * 1 years;

    // Emit a DomainRegistrationRenewed event
    emit DomainRegistrationRenewed(domainName, domain.expirationDate, block.timestamp);
}
```
Explanation:

- This function first checks if the domain name is registered by calling the `isDomainRegistered` helper function. If it's not, the function throws an error and terminates.
- It then checks if the sender of the transaction (`msg.sender`) is the owner of the domain. If not, the function throws an error and terminates.
- The function checks if the correct renewal fee has been paid by the sender. If the fee is insufficient, the function throws an error and terminates.
- The expiration date of the domain is extended by the number of additional years provided as a parameter to the function.
- Finally, it emits a `DomainRegistrationRenewed` event, which includes the domain name, the new expiration date, and the timestamp of the renewal.

## 1.5. Cancellation of Domain Names

Function Name: `cancelDomainRegistration`

Parameters:

- `domainName` (string): The name of the domain that the owner wants to cancel.

Pseudocode:
```Solidity
function cancelDomainRegistration(string domainName) external {
    // Check if the domain name is registered
    require(isDomainRegistered(domainName), "Domain not registered.");

    // Check if the sender is the owner of the domain
    Domain domain = domainRegistry[domainName];
    require(msg.sender == domain.owner, "Only the domain owner can cancel registration.");

    // Remove the domain from the registry
    delete domainRegistry[domainName];

    // Emit a DomainRegistrationCancelled event
    emit DomainRegistrationCancelled(domainName, block.timestamp);
}
```
Explanation:

- This function first checks if the domain name is registered by calling the `isDomainRegistered` helper function. If it's not, the function throws an error and terminates.
- It then checks if the sender of the transaction (`msg.sender`) is the owner of the domain. If not, the function throws an error and terminates.
- The function then removes the domain from the domain registry by using the `delete` keyword.
- Finally, it emits a `DomainRegistrationCancelled` event, which includes the domain name and the timestamp of the cancellation.

# 2. DNS record management:

    emit DNSRecordAdded(domainName, recordType, recordValue, block.timestamp);
}
```
Explanation:

- This function first checks if the domain name is registered and if the sender of the transaction is the owner of the domain.
- It then verifies the format and correctness of the DNS record by calling the `isValidDNSRecord` helper function.
- After that, it adds the DNS record to the domain in the domain registry.
- Finally, it emits a `DNSRecordAdded` event, which includes the domain name, the type and value of the DNS record, and the timestamp of the addition.

## 2.2. Update existing DNS records
