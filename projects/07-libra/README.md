## Basic Information
Project Name: Libra - Decentralized payment system which empowered the next e-commerce
Project Initiation Date: Mar 2022

## Project Overview
Libra is a rebellious payment system crafted exclusively for the Web 3 universe. We dream of an online economy where secure transactions are achievable for all, no matter the distance. Our immediate mission: to focus on sparking sales and championing onboarding in the dynamic blockchain domain.


## Project introduction
The current state of Web 2 payments is characterized by various challenges that impede efficiency, security, and global accessibility.

Conventional transactions, particularly in cross-border contexts, are often sluggish and costly, taking days to settle with burdensome fees. This negatively impacts both businesses and consumers.

Centralized platforms exert significant control over user data and payment processes, leaving users vulnerable to account suspensions and financial setbacks. This lack of autonomy and dependence on intermediaries raises concerns about data privacy and financial freedom.

The fragmented global economy further complicates international commerce, with geopolitical conflicts, economic clashes, and sanctions limiting market access and hindering trade.

Additionally, the onboarding process for new users is hindered by lengthy and complex Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. The extensive verification requirements imposed by financial institutions and payment processors can be time-consuming and inconvenient, discouraging potential users from participating in the digital economy.

Addressing these challenges is pivotal for the advancement of digital payments. Libra emerges as a transformative solution in the Web 3 era by harnessing the potential of blockchain technology. It empowers users with control over transactions and data, prioritizing security and transparency. With a user-centric approach, Libra streamlines onboarding, bridging the gap between blockchain and mainstream adoption. Experience the future of payments with Libra's decentralized framework.
