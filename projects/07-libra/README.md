## Basic Information

**Project Name:** Libra - Decentralized payment system which empowered the next e-commerce

**Project Initiation Date:** Mar 2022

## Project overview

Libra is a rebellious payment system crafted exclusively for the Web 3 universe. We dream of an online economy where secure transactions are achievable for all, no matter the distance. Our immediate mission: to focus on sparking sales and championing onboarding in the dynamic blockchain domain.

## Project introduction
### Motivation

The global e-commerce industry continues to experience robust growth across all regions. Forecasts indicate a projected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9% from 2022 to 2026. This growth is expected to drive the global e-commerce transaction value from approximately $6 trillion in 2022 to over $8.5 trillion by 2026.

Although cryptocurrencies have seen significant market capitalization, surpassing $2 trillion in 2022 and remaining above $1 trillion today, their adoption for consumer purchases remains limited. According to a global survey by FIS, 77% of respondents purchase cryptocurrencies as investments, while only 18% use them to pay for goods and services. As a result, cryptocurrencies accounted for less than 0.2% of the global e-commerce transaction value in 2022, as reported in The Global Payment Report 2023.

However, merchants are increasingly recognizing the benefits of accepting cryptocurrencies as payment. They gain access to a new customer base, enjoy higher average transaction values, experience faster settlement times, and benefit from lower transaction fees.

### About Libra

Libra is a decentralized payment system designed to empower the next generation of e-commerce. Its mission is to facilitate the seamless adoption of cryptocurrency payments in online transactions, with a particular focus on onboarding and sales processes.

During this hackathon, our primary focus will be on Libra Checkout. This innovative product is a no-code solution that enables users to start selling their products within minutes. With just three simple steps—connecting their wallet, publishing a sales page, and collecting revenue—users can quickly set up their online store.

Furthermore, Libra provides advanced features that allow merchants to analyze sales performance and integrate with their existing systems, such as CRM, through the Libra API and Libra Webhook.

### Why choose Libra

- **Convenience and Fast Onboarding Process:** Libra offers a streamlined onboarding process, eliminating burdensome requirements like KYC verification or having a legally established business. Merchants can quickly create a sales page, start selling their products, and generate revenue promptly. The sales page is optimized for social network sharing, integrates with various wallets, and provides a dashboard to monitor conversion rates, revenue, and customer management.
- **Decentralization:** Libra ensures decentralization by giving merchants full control over their wallets when integrating with the platform. This means that Libra has no access to the user's wallet or assets. By maintaining control over their funds, merchants have increased security and autonomy in managing their financial transactions.
- **Global Coverage:** Libra offers global coverage, enabling merchants to sell products worldwide. Consumers can conveniently purchase items from anywhere using cryptocurrencies, facilitating seamless and border-less transactions.
- **Near Zero Fees:** Libra offers near-zero fees, thanks to the use of cryptocurrencies. Consumers only pay a small gas fee for transactions, as payments directly go from their account to the merchant's account.
### Use Cases

- **Small businesses** seeking a rapid onboarding process to start selling their products. By using Libra, they can avoid the lengthy process of obtaining traditional web2 payments, including setting up a business account, undergoing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, and waiting for days or even weeks to start selling.
- **Content creators** who can leverage Libra for tipping, donations, sponsorships, and offering exclusive paid content.
- **Existing businesses** looking to embrace cryptocurrencies as a new payment method. By utilizing Libra's API and webhook, these businesses can easily accept cryptocurrency payments without the need to build their own infrastructure.
