PENGUINS IN 5.\r\n\r\nIf Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet\r\nagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\r\nbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\r\nthough, I'd have to take the Penguins.\r\n\r\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\r\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\r\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\r\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\r\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\r\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\r\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\r\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\r\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\r\nall-round players in the NHL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndchhabra@stpl.ists.ca","completion":"hockey"}

Without a good starting point, it's hard\r\n>    to make adjustments in your swing.\r\n\r\nI don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with\r\nthe A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back\r\nproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance\r\ncaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts\r\nhim. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're\r\ncold, its a hitch. \r\n\r\n>First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\r\n>and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\r\n>will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\r\n>the bathead more freely.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable\r\nwith for more than a few months.

Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to\r\ntie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).\r\n\r\nThe A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo\r\nhomer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the\r\n7th for the other Tiger run.\r\n\r\nJohn Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting\r\nthrough the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas\r\nin the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was\r\nreplaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and\r\nfinally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while\r\nWitt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.\r\n\r\nIn the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said\r\nits one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It\r\nwas a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously\r\nvery happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.\r\n\r\nConsidering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:\r\n\r\n                WOOF!

FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I \r\nthink you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.

IMO, the latter is a nice\r\nand unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not\r\nthink that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of\r\npeople that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.\r\n\r\nIf the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not \r\ncentral to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is\r\nwhether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'\r\nwould have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to\r\nplay in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to\r\nbuilders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although\r\nit was the chicken.....)\r\n\r\n>Exactly true.

Ville Siren's slap\r\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\r\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\r\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\r\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\r\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\r\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\r\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\r\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\r\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \r\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\r\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\r\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\r\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\r\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\r\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\r\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\r\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\r\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \r\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\r\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\r\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\r\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\r\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\r\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\r\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\r\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\r\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\r\n\r\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\r\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\r\n to try no combinations.\r\n\r\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\r\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\r\n Stillman good on defense.\r\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\r\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\r\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\r\n\r\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\r\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\r\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\r\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\r\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n Starting lines:\r\n\r\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\r\n\r\n  35.

I missed something here.  First, forget Keith\r\nMitchell.

If a player does well at AA and then\r\ndoes not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't\r\nbelong in the bigs?\r\n\r\nNow, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)\r\nhe jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was\r\nreturned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now\r\nhis career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your \r\npoint.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now\r\nhe's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.\r\nDuh.\r\n\r\n\r\n>That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they\r\n>really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,\r\n>or some combination of the two.

Why would anyone talk about Gainey?\r\n \r\n\"I hate the Habs\" ?...you sound like a 10-year old.  This\r\nstatement is just further exemplifies your total inability to\r\nargue objectively about hockey.  Don't give me this crap about\r\n\"cogent arguments\"...I've yet to read something of yours that is\r\ncogent.  You consistently argue with: (1) emotion; (2) huge,\r\nsweeping statements\r\n \r\nFrankly, you have a very unconvincing style.\r\n \r\nI'm not defending Bob Gainey...frankly, I don't care for him all\r\nthat much.  But your dismissal of him as something less than an\r\neffective hockey player is tiresome...it has no basis in\r\nanything.  How many Calders did he win? I think it was four (go\r\nahead and refresh my memory).  What about the Conn Smythe?  Was\r\nthat a fluke?  Yeah, not the makings of a hockey superstar, I\r\nknow, but try to have a reason, any reason, to shoot him down.\r\n \r\n>>>go  around.  Who would you rather have as your \"checking\"\r\n>>>centre?  Doug Gilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would\r\n>>>take either Gretzky or Mario as my \"checking\" centres.  Do you\r\n>>>think Gretzky could cover Bob Gainey?\r\n \r\n>>I'm really sorry Roger, but you have lost me completely here. \r\n>>Why don't you ask me if I would rather have Jesus Christ,\r\n>>himself, in nets?\r\n \r\n>Did he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not,\r\n>why would you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey\r\n>players here.  If you can't follow the conversation don't follow\r\n>up.  As I said previously, it is not my responsibility to\r\n>educate you.\r\n \r\nHey cowboy!  You're the \"expert\" who introduced the idiotic\r\ncomparison of Gainey with Gretzky and Lemieux...you figure it\r\nout.\r\n \r\n>>Now, if you were to compare, say for example, Bob Gainey with\r\n>>Guy Carbonneau, you would have a balanced comparison.\r\n \r\n>Sure.  Two journeymen.  Big deal.  Neither one of them is worth\r\n>discussing.\r\n \r\nHow many individual awards between them? Eight...I don't remember\r\n(once again, please feel free to refresh my memory...and try to\r\nbe as sarcastic as possible about my \"hockey education\").\r\n \r\n>I'm wrong AGAIN...hmmm, let's see...where was I wrong in the\r\n \r\n>>>I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter.\r\n \r\nOH MY GOD!!!  Did I say that?  Roger...what's your point?  Fuhr\r\nis a goaltender, goaltender's don't \"plug\"...in his prime, he was\r\none of the best.  Sanderson was a scrapper...if you stick him on\r\nyou may as well include half the Flyers team of the same era.\r\n \r\n>>first place?  I'm only guessing here, Rog, but I have a feeling\r\n>>that you've setup a \"You're wrong again\" macro key on your\r\n>>machine.\r\n \r\n>That is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time\r\n>responding to any of your, or Greg's, postings then I will be\r\n>sure to implement that very macro.\r\n \r\nOh Roger, you shouldn't...really.  I don't deserve this...you are\r\nfar too accomodating already.\r\n \r\n>>I would suggest that your comment: \"And when the press runs out\r\n>>of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to\r\n>>hype the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa Tikkannen, Butch Goring,\r\n>>Bob Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek Sanderson, Wayne\r\n>>Cashman, Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri Richard,\r\n>>Dick Duff...and so on...\" demonstrates a blanket disregard for\r\n>>these individuals as contributors to the game...so yes, settle\r\n>>down...nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods.\r\n \r\n>Tarasov claimed that Gainey was a \"hockey god.\"  And Greg ate\r\n>it up. And that is what this thread is all about.  If you didn't\r\n>know  that then why are you responding?\r\n \r\nYou seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into\r\nyour sweeping, vacuous statement...that's why.  If you want to\r\ndebate Gainey, go ahead...but why bring up everybody else?  How\r\ndoes it support your argument?  Do you have an argument, or do\r\nyou just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us?\r\n \r\n \r\n>And as for \"blanket disregard for these individuals\", I can\r\n>remember  Leaf teams, purely populated by such \"individuals\",\r\n>winning four Stanley Cups.  Teams.  No one ran around telling\r\n>us that George Armstrong was the best hockey player in the\r\n>world.\r\n \r\nGreat.  I couldn't agree more.  The Flyers won two cups for the\r\nsame reasons...deservedly so.  So what?  I don't get it.  Are you\r\nangry that the Leafs didn't get more recognition?  \r\n \r\nYou seem to think these pluggers are \"hyped\"...I don't\r\nagree...plain and simple.  If you're last statement is some sort\r\nof compromise, fair enough.\r\n \r\n>>>You might consider developing your own style.  After all,\r\n>>>imitation is  the sincerest form of flattery and I am quite\r\n>>>sure that flattery is not  your intention.\r\n>> \r\n>>C'mon...it has a nice ring to it...and admit it, you had a good\r\n>>laugh.\r\n \r\n>Right.  I had to get to the end of your posting before I\r\n>realized you were  a complete joke.\r\n \r\nNot a pleasant bone in your body, eh Rog?  Why are you so\r\nunhappy?  Not getting invited to enough parties?  What?\r\n \r\n>In the future, if you are going to respond to my postings I\r\n>would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument\r\n>supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most\r\n>of the rest of us would recognize.\r\n \r\nRoger, why are you under the impression that responding to your\r\nposts is some great honour?  You really should stop...it sounds\r\na little bit pathetic.  Frankly, it's about as honourable as a\r\ngood fart.\r\n \r\ncongenially, as always, \r\n \r\njd\r\n \r\n-- \r\nJames David \r\nj3david@student.business.uwo.ca/s\r\n\r\nj3david@sms.business.uwo.ca (James David)\r\nWestern Business School  --  London, Ontario","completion":"hockey"}
