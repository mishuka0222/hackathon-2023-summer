It might be that pre-back\nproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance\ncaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts\nhim. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're\ncold, its a hitch. \n\n>First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\n>and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.

He changes his stance so much, he loses\ntrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was \nclearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to\nme. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because\nhe's changed his stance so much.\n\nI'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting\nall the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw\nhimself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting\npractice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged\nbad hitting habits.\n\n\n\n\nRuss Smith\n*******************************************************************************\n\"I don't know anything about X's, but I know about some O.\"              \n                  George Gervin on being an assistant coach\n********************************************************************************","completion":"baseball"}

The referee originally \nsignalled no goal but the video replay \"judges\" initiated contact with\nthe referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is\nunheard of.

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\n\n  35.

The\nargument was\n\n1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.\n2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.\n\n3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and\nearned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%\nof defense and pitching is 88% of defense.\n4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.\n\nPete is usually sharper than that.

Best \nstrategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.\nTaylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,\nwhen the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell\nand will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.\n\n     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; \nwhat's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).\n\nOthers can add on their opinions as well.\n\nKevin L.

It turns out that the mask is\ncustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his\/her face through a\npiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face\nand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic\nwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a\nplaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12\nminutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the\ngoalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves\npadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  \nJohn Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. \n\n>He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a\n>new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current\n>mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was \n>*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two\n>fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed\n>back-ground.\n\nYeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.\n \n>The best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.\n>It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking \n>black panther on the forehead -- it *has* to be a new mask for Felix\n>Potvin, but he never said whose it was.\n\nActually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.

Sanderson was a scrapper...if you stick him on\nyou may as well include half the Flyers team of the same era.\n \n>>first place?  I'm only guessing here, Rog, but I have a feeling\n>>that you've setup a \"You're wrong again\" macro key on your\n>>machine.\n \n>That is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time\n>responding to any of your, or Greg's, postings then I will be\n>sure to implement that very macro.\n \nOh Roger, you shouldn't...really.  I don't deserve this...you are\nfar too accomodating already.\n \n>>I would suggest that your comment: \"And when the press runs out\n>>of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to\n>>hype the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa Tikkannen, Butch Goring,\n>>Bob Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek Sanderson, Wayne\n>>Cashman, Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri Richard,\n>>Dick Duff...and so on...\" demonstrates a blanket disregard for\n>>these individuals as contributors to the game...so yes, settle\n>>down...nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods.\n \n>Tarasov claimed that Gainey was a \"hockey god.\"  And Greg ate\n>it up. And that is what this thread is all about.  If you didn't\n>know  that then why are you responding?\n \nYou seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into\nyour sweeping, vacuous statement...that's why.  If you want to\ndebate Gainey, go ahead...but why bring up everybody else?  How\ndoes it support your argument?  Do you have an argument, or do\nyou just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us?\n \n \n>And as for \"blanket disregard for these individuals\", I can\n>remember  Leaf teams, purely populated by such \"individuals\",\n>winning four Stanley Cups.  Teams.  No one ran around telling\n>us that George Armstrong was the best hockey player in the\n>world.\n \nGreat.  I couldn't agree more.  The Flyers won two cups for the\nsame reasons...deservedly so.  So what?  I don't get it.  Are you\nangry that the Leafs didn't get more recognition?  \n \nYou seem to think these pluggers are \"hyped\"...I don't\nagree...plain and simple.  If you're last statement is some sort\nof compromise, fair enough.\n \n>>>You might consider developing your own style.  After all,\n>>>imitation is  the sincerest form of flattery and I am quite\n>>>sure that flattery is not  your intention.\n>> \n>>C'mon...it has a nice ring to it...and admit it, you had a good\n>>laugh.\n \n>Right.  I had to get to the end of your posting before I\n>realized you were  a complete joke.\n \nNot a pleasant bone in your body, eh Rog?  Why are you so\nunhappy?  Not getting invited to enough parties?  What?\n \n>In the future, if you are going to respond to my postings I\n>would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument\n>supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most\n>of the rest of us would recognize.\n \nRoger, why are you under the impression that responding to your\nposts is some great honour?  You really should stop...it sounds\na little bit pathetic.
