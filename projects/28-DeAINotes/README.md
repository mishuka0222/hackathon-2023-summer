## Overall Project Description

### Project Background
With the development of the Internet technology, more and more people are using the network to get and share information, learn and work. However, most of the current network applications are based on centralized servers and databases to store and manage user data, which poses some problems and risks such as data security, privacy, reliability, and scalability. On the other hand, when people use network applications, they also face challenges such as information overload, fragmentation, and low efficiency, and need better tools to help them record and manage their personal learning notes and knowledge.

In order to solve these problems, we proposed the Decentralized AI Notes project, which is a decentralized AI notes application that aims to help users to record and manage their personal learning notes and knowledge. The application uses blockchain technology and CESS distributed storage to realize decentralized storage and management of data, and at the same time uses artificial intelligence technology and natural language processing technology to provide intelligent note management and search functions. Users can create personal notebooks, add notes, tags and attachments, and use intelligent search and recommendation functions to browse and find notes.

### Project Introduction
Decentralized AI Notes is a decentralized notes application that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence technology, which can help users to record and manage their personal learning notes and knowledge safely, efficiently, and intelligently. This application does not rely on any centralized server or database, but uses blockchain technology based on CESS distributed storage to encrypt and disperse user data to multiple nodes, thus ensuring the security, privacy, reliability and scalability of the data.

At the same time, the application also uses artificial intelligence technology and natural language processing technology to provide users with intelligent note management and search functions, such as automatic classification, summarization, keyword extraction, semantic retrieval, similar note recommendation, etc.

Users can conveniently create personal notebooks, add notes, tags and attachments, and use intelligent search and recommendation functions to quickly browse and find notes. Decentralized AI Notes is committed to providing users with a secure, efficient and intelligent note management tool to improve their learning and work efficiency.
