Programmable and User-Defined Crypto Wallet based on Account Abstraction
基于账户抽象的智能合约钱包

The significant account abstraction (AA) upgrade makes blockchain accounts programmable via smart contracts to allow users freely self-define the logics and settings of their accounts. Based on AA our new crypto wallet can improve the functionalities, performance and user experience of user accounts as good as Web2 while maintaining the decentralization of Web3. Unlike other wallets, instead of providing all wallet functionalities and features by ourselves, we gather third-party smart contract developers to develop their account applications in our wallet. In this way we build an ecosystem like App Store in our wallet with all different third-party account services to better meet different user demands and make our wallet fully customized for each user.
