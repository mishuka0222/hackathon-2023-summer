#### Vane-Trust is a trust leverager tool for solo online retailers and businesses.

*Digital experience re-imagined*


## Problem statements

  - The cost of making a mistake in crypto is very huge, we have seen that on wrong addresses incidents.

  - Solo online retailers faces backlash from customers as trust is at stake and scamming cases have risen to the ceiling.

  - There are no better tools to ensure we have trust minimized interactions between retailers and customers.

  ## Proposed Solutions By Vane-Trust

  - Enabling multi party partial account ownership, address verification and reverting functionality with incentive punishment to bad actors

  - WhatsApp Interface integration as we believe most of solopreneuers  use WhatsApp, Instagram as their platforms with much network effect.

  - We only want to supercharge and re-imagine our digital interactions using the set of composable Vane tools and services.

  - Ads on chain, enabling greater audience with no censorship and access the potential customers from Dexs platforms, chain explorers and NFTs platforms.
